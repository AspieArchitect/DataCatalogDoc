# Light Weight Decision Register
## What is a light weight decision register?
The purpose of a light weight decision register is to record the WHY rather than the WHAT.

Decisions are taken
1. With the knowledge available at the time
1. In good faith
1. Facing a number of constraints such as imperfect knowledge, deadlines, money
1. With an eye on what the actual delivery REALLY is.

It is easy to criticise decisions with the benefit of hindsight.  By recording the WHY we ensure that hindsight is not myopic.
